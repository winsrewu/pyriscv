# pyriscv
A RISCV Emulator written in Python, supports RV32I instruction set.

Do NOT support csr instructions.

Requires:
  python3.4+
  
No other libraries!!

# run
```bash
cd app/c
./build.sh
python3 ../../src/pyriscv.py app.mem
```

# good to know
- The default entry point is 0x0.
- FENCE and FENCE.I instructions do NOT have any effect on the emulator.
- EBREAK instruction do NOT have any effect on the emulator.
- for ECALL, a7 register is for passing system call number, a0-a6 registers are for passing arguments (a0 for the first argument),
return value is stored in a0 register.
- write system call should only write to STDOUT, whose fileno is 1.
- read system call should only read from STDIN, whose fileno is 0.
- cpp is really complicated, i tried to use cpp's iostream to output, but failed (i've tested it on spike, it will try to load from 0x0, idk why). But just using g++ to compile some simple stuff is ok.
- I now know why. There're some problems with the linker script, and i fixed it. Now most of the code should work fine.
- Global pointer is really easy to fail, you may need to adjust it manually for different programs.
For instance, for some programs, change that line from
``__global_pointer$ = MIN(__PREINIT_ARRAY_BEGIN__ + 0x800,
MAX(__DATA_BEGIN__ + 0x800, __BSS_END__ - 0x800));``
to ``  __global_pointer$ = MIN(__SDATA_BEGIN__ + 0x800,
MAX(__DATA_BEGIN__ + 0x800, __BSS_END__ - 0x800));`` will make it work.
I made two versions of link script, you can check the difference between them through the build script of cpp-stream and cpp-stream-2. If this still doesn't work, you may modify the link script manually or just disable the global pointer feature
via ``-Wl,--no-relax-gp`` option.

| 64     | write    | fd, ptr, len | number of bytes written |
